# AmphoraHealth
This is my repository of the challenge for the application to the career in Amphora Health

The full process is documented in the file "challenge.py"

I also share 2 other files about the results of the overall data:

A .txt file that contains the numeric value of the correlation coefficient between the UCI usage column and the other ones, I used two measures of rank correlation, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient

The other file is a .png image that maps those values to get a more visual result.
